function degR = degR()
% function degR = degR()
%
% return increment RankineDeg to basic temperature incremet unit (KelvinDeg) conversion factor
% note: this is the increment, i.e. difference between two temperatures of one degree Celcius, not the temperature itself
%
% example

degR = 1/1.8;   % 1 change of one degree Rankine this much change of one degree Kelvin
