% return increment CelsiusDeg to basic temperature incremet unit (KelvinDeg) conversion factor
% note: this is the increment, i.e. difference between two temperatures of one degree Celcius, not the temperature itself

% example

degC = 1;   % yes, a change of one degree Celcius is the same amount as a change of one degree Kelvin
